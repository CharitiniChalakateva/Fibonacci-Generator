# Fibonacci-Generator

This repository contains a Python program to create a file with the numbers of the Fibonacci series.

                     - Description -

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number consists of the sum of the previous two numbers. 
The sequence starts with the numbers 0 and 1.

This particular implementation of the Fibonacci sequence uses a recursive function to calculate the Fibonacci number for a number n. 
In addition, there is a function to create a file with the numbers of the Fibonacci series up to a certain number n. 
This file has the format "fibonacci_n.txt", where n is the number up to which the Fibonacci numbers are generated.
